The Tap Card iOS SDK makes it quick and easy to build an excellent payment experience in your iOS app. We provide powerful and customizable UI screens and elements that can be used out-of-the-box to collect your users' payment details. We also expose the low-level APIs that power those UIs so that you can build fully custom experiences.

Learn about our [Tap Identity Authentication](https://tappayments.api-docs.io/2.0/authentication) to verify the identity of your users on iOS.

Get started with our [documentation guide](https://www.tap.company/eg/en/developers) and [example projects](https://github.com/Tap-Payments/TapCardCheckOutKit/tree/main/TapCardCheckOutKit/TapCardCheckoutExample.)

**Simplified security**: We make it simple for you to collect sensitive data such as credit card numbers and remain PCI compliant. This means the sensitive data is sent directly to Tap instead of passing through your server.

*SCA-ready**: The SDK automatically performs native [3D Secure authentication](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/3d-secure) .

**Native UI**: We provide native screens and elements to collect payment details. For example, [PaymentSheet](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=ios) is a prebuilt UI that combines all the steps required to pay - collecting payment details, billing details, and confirming the payment - into a single sheet that displays on top of your app.
